### Problem Statement:
Many learners struggle to identify what they need to learn when starting a new topic. This can be overwhelming, and they may waste time studying unnecessary information or miss critical concepts.

### Identification and Explanation of Problem Statement:
The problem is that learners often do not have a clear idea of what they need to learn when starting a new topic. They may not have the background knowledge to understand the topic fully, or they may not know which concepts are most important to focus on. This can lead to confusion and frustration, resulting in wasted time and reduced learning outcomes.

### Description of a Creative Solution to the Issue Identified:
A potential solution to this problem is DeltaLearn, an edtech platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze a topic and break it down into manageable chunks of information. Users can input the topic they want to learn about, and DeltaLearn will identify the essential concepts they need to understand, suggest appropriate learning resources, and track their progress.

### Concept Behind Proposed Solution:
DeltaLearn uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze the topic and identify the most critical concepts. It then suggests relevant learning resources, such as articles, videos, and interactive quizzes, to help users understand each concept fully. The platform also tracks the user's progress, adapting its recommendations based on their performance and providing personalized feedback.

### Project's Purpose and Goals:
The primary goal of DeltaLearn is to help learners maximize their learning outcomes by providing a clear roadmap of what they need to learn and how to do it. The platform aims to be user-friendly, accessible, and personalized to each user's needs.

### Feasibility of Solution:
The feasibility of DeltaLearn depends on the availability of high-quality learning resources and the accuracy of the natural language processing algorithms. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning make this solution increasingly feasible.

### Advantages:

* DeltaLearn provides learners with a clear roadmap of what they need to learn, reducing confusion and wasted time.
* The platform suggests relevant learning resources, making the learning process more efficient and effective.
* DeltaLearn tracks the user's progress, providing personalized feedback and adapting its recommendations based on their performance.

### Disadvantages:

* DeltaLearn relies on the accuracy of its natural language processing algorithms, which may not be perfect and could lead to errors in recommendations.
* The platform may be limited by the availability and quality of existing learning resources for certain topics.
