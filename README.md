#the trained models are saved in the json format to save storage space

#To use the saved model, place both the files("model.json" and "model.h") in same directory with "detect.py" file

#open terminal at the current directory and execute the "detect.py" in terminal with path of the image file of MRI scan of Brain as command line argument

  -->example: 

command for windows 10 : py detect.py [IMG-FILE_PATH]

#the result will be displayed in the very next line

#our project work's
