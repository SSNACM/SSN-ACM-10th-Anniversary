<h2>Description of project</h2>
<p>A web platform called "NourishNow" has been suggested as a solution to the problems of food wastage and food poverty. This novel platform seeks to link food providers, such as eateries, hotels, and caterers, with disadvantaged groups, such as homeless shelters, food banks, and low-income families.<br><br>The platform's most notable features include the ability for food providers to submit information about their excess food, which is then matched with local organisations in need of food assistance. People in need can search the accessible list of food contributions and claim them based on their particular requirements.<br><br>"NourishNow" is an essential tool for coordinating and simplifying the process of organising for food pick-up and delivery to those in need. Furthermore, the programme includes a feedback and evaluation system to guarantee the quality and safety of donated food.<br><br>This leading-edge platform provides a one-of-a-kind value proposition of simple, convenient, and cost-effective food sharing for both food suppliers and organisations that help people in need. This feature motivates companies to reduce waste and support sustainability in order to receive positive publicity for their corporate citizenship efforts while also contributing to the well-being of society. It also enables organisations that service people in need to gain access to a broader variety of food investments, reducing the instability of food and improving the health and well-being of those they serve.<br><br>As a whole, "NourishNow" serves an all-encompassing answer for food providers as well as organisations that assist people in need, resulting in a more effective and equitable food system that benefits all parties concerned. This web platform represents a move forward in development and the contemporary world, utilising technology to address issues in society and create humanity.</p>
