CNN_brain_tumour_classification

**Problem Statement:**
The problem addressed in this project is the accurate identification of tumors in medical images using deep learning. The current methods of tumor identification are time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in treatment. Therefore, there is a need to develop a deep learning model that can accurately and efficiently identify tumors in medical images, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival rates.

**Scope:**
The successful completion of this project will have significant implications for the early detection and treatment of tumors, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival rates. The model developed can be used by radiologists and medical professionals to accurately identify tumors in medical images in a timely and efficient manner, reducing the workload and improving the quality of healthcare.

**Info**

#the trained models are saved in the json format to save storage space

#To use the saved model, place both the files("model.json" and "model.h") in same directory with "detect.py" file

#open terminal at the current directory and execute the "detect.py" in terminal with path of the image file of MRI scan of Brain as command line argument

  -example: 

command for windows 10 : py detect.py [IMG-FILE_PATH]

#the result will be displayed in the very next line

#our project work's
